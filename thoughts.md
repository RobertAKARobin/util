# Thinking through things

-	HTML validation
	-	https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-validate
		-	Doesn't support autofix: https://gitlab.com/html-validate/html-validate/-/issues/116
		-	86k weekly downloads
	-	https://www.npmjs.com/package/markuplint
		-	Like that it isn't an ESLint package
		-	As of v4.9.1 doesn't throw enough errors; fails silently
		-	Missing attr ordering
		-	29k weekly downloads
	-	https://www.npmjs.com/package/@html-eslint/eslint-plugin
		-	Why is this an ESLint package? HTML is not Javascript
		-	Missing attr newline: https://github.com/yeonjuan/html-eslint/issues/191
		-	37k weekly downloads
-	Using `[on]` attributes
	-	+ Easier to debug in HTML
	-	+ Don't need to place event listeners
	-	- Will error if page doesn't have JS
	-	- Verbose
	-	- Not best practice
	-	- If we want to replace the attribute with in-memory listeners, the only way is to querySelectorAll all of the attributes
-	Using JS expressions instead of HTML tags
	-	+ Can set private properties inline
	-	+ Has typing out of the box
	-	+ Don't have to manually import
	-	- Will always call constructor and/or chained functions
	-	- Extra step: have to translate to comment
-	Router outlet
	-	Page extends RouterOutlet
		-	- Rebuilds page on every route
	-	Argument to Resolver
		-	- Resolver is just to map routes to views; shouldn't actually _do_ anything
	-	Renderer
		-	- Importing would import/cache everthing else?
-	Rerendering
	-	toString
		-	returns comment with ID
			-	On first render
				-	If comment with ID
					-	Replace comment with cached component
			-	On rerender
				-	If element with ID
					-	If Component
						-	Replace attributes
						-	cachedComponent.render()
					-	If not component
						-	Replace attributes
						-	Replace children with updatedComponent.childNodes
		-	renders and returns outerHTML
			-	Requires rendering the template twice, which would instantiate double the components
		-	returns outerHTML
			-	On new component, has no content
			-	On existing component, has outdated content
			-	Then render template
-	Layout
	-	Set arbitrary flags on page that determine which outer components get turned on/off?
		-	Gets messy if outer is complicated
	-	Layout component instances
		-	`pageInstace.layout = (new LayoutInstance() || existingLayoutInstance)`
		-	`layout.template = () => this.page`
-	Rerendering
	-	Replace what?
		-	Replace element
			-	/default/
			-	Descending to contents doesn't make sense
		-	Replace element attributes + replace contents
			-	outerHTML
		-	Replace element attributes + evaluate contents
			-	attributes
		-	Replace element attributes
			-	attributes-skip
		-	Replace contents
			-	innerHTML
			-	Descending to contents doesn't make sense
		-	Replace nothing + evaluate contents
			-	static
		-	Replace nothing
			-	static-skip
		-	...replace element + keep contents?
			-	Is that useful?
-	Components need a UID so that SSG pages have a way of differentiating between instances
	-	...unless every instance is a new one?

## Existing frameworks

-	Lit
	-	Have to extend HTMLElement
	-	HTML tagged templates are a little annoying
	-	Have to use shadow DOM for lit-ssr
	-	Have to render first before can rerender
-	Svelte
	-	Magic syntax, e.g. `$` state prefixes
	-	Don't care for route structure
-	Preact
	-	Clunky state management
-	lwc
	-	Limited Typescript support
-	Marko
	-	Weird custom syntax
-	Riot.js
	-	Old and not actively maintained?
-	Stencil
