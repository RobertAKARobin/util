Done:

-	Persist state for elements with UIDs
-	Bug: Instances not binding to elements on rerender
-	`bind` without needing page referesh
-	Route names for HTML IDs
-	Fix `route()` names not bring strongly typed
-	CSS to external

-	CSS breakpoints
-	Declare CSS variables inline
-	Get CSS variable names inline
-	Support nested tokens

## Notes

-	Components need a UID so that SSG pages have a way of differentiating between instances
	-	...unless every instance is a new one?
